# Wigle2KML-py
coverts wigle's API json output to KML for Geo / Google Earth

There are other similar tools, this one is pretty simple.  
```python
python3 wigle2kml.py filename.json output.kml
```
The KML file can then be imported into Google Earth or other tools that support KML

Fair disclosure: an LLM assisted in writing this.  It took a few minutes rather than a long time to troubleshoot.  If this helps you, thank the people that came before me that fed the LLMs.
